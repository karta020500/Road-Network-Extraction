# Road-Network-Extraction

Road extraction from remote-sensing imagery can be considered as a classification process in which pixels are divided into road class and others. Apart from the spectral information of satellite imagery, textural and contextual information are useful to accomplish this
task. Different texture parameters show different aspects of textural behavior in a defined neighborhood of a given pixel. This project develops a systematic procedure to extract roads in different scales depending on the resolution of images. The developed procedure to extract roads and reconstruct the network can be divided into two steps. The first step, obtaining texture parameters including contrast, entropy and homogeneity of each pixel using gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM); afterwards, support vector machine (SVM) is used as a classifier to identify road pixels. Finally, linear feature detection of the road network with radon transform isperformed to trace road pixel.
